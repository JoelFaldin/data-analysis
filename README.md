# 📊 Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains three projects developed for academy purposes. The focus is on data analysis, data mining and data visualization using Python and R.
Each project explores different aspects of working with data, from modeling to user-friendly applications.

## 🌐 Project 1: Data mining models (Python)

This project was developed for a Data Mining course. It applies different machine learning algorithms on a selected dataset to perform classification tasks.
Techniques used:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks

The goal was to process and explore the dataset, train and evaluate different models and compare performance metrics between them.

## 📈 Project 2: Data visualization Desktop app (Python + Tkinter)

This is a simple desktop application built using Python and Tkinter.
It allows users to:

- Upload an excel file
- Automatically generate frequency tables, graphs and display monthly trends

Some functionalities:

- GUI for selecting files
- Interactive charts
- Data processing utilities

## ®️ Project 3: Data visualization app (R)

This project is a reimplementation of Project 2, using R language. It replicates the same functionalities:

- Excel input
- Frequency table generation
- Graph creation
- Time-based analysis
